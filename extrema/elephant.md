## background
natural language can be embedded in an n dim space, currently we optimize the space mathematically ie pca

## 1. Embed Ideas not Words
This aligns with how humans think—our cognition often operates on abstract concepts rather than discrete tokens.
A point in this n dim space is a system characterized by the magnitude of each nonzero dim, ie a moderately ordered system
System can be arbitrary, idea applies to language itself rather than a person particle thing or group of things

## 2. Semantic Dimensions as Conceptual Axes
Instead of letting statistical variance (PCA) define dimensions, we could define each dimension by a semantic extreme.
“chaos” ↔ “order” and “individualism” ↔ “collectivism”

## 3. Reasoning is to Navigate Space
Exploring Neighborhoods of Ideas
Finding paths between concepts (e.g., “freedom” → “responsibility” via “agency”)
Combining dimensions (e.g., “abstract + collectivism” might point to “utopia”)

## 4. The Space is Closed
Meaning all reasoning must occur within it, avoiding paradoxes or undefined concepts.
